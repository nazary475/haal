      question: "What does Haal Lab do?",
      answer:
        "Haal Lab is a deep-tech AI engineering company that builds private, intelligent, and reliable AI systems. We deliver four capabilities: Local AI Systems (private on-prem inference), LLM Applications (assistants and agents), Knowledge Intelligence (RAG and semantic search), and AI Infrastructure (deployment and optimization).",
    },
    {
      question: "Who is Haal Lab for?",
      answer:
        "Haal Lab works with businesses, startups, researchers, and organizations that need custom AI solutions — particularly those with privacy, compliance, or data-sovereignty requirements that rule out generic cloud AI services.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Haal Lab build private or on-premises AI?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Privacy-first architecture is one of our core principles. We build AI systems that run entirely on your infrastructure — on workstations, on-prem servers, or air-gapped clusters — using open-weight models so your data never leaves your environment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What technologies does Haal Lab use?",
      answer:
        "Our stack includes open-weight LLMs, llama.cpp, vLLM, Triton, GGUF format, BGE-M3 embeddings, vector databases (Qdrant, Postgres with pgvector), LangGraph for agent orchestration, Kubernetes, and CUDA for GPU acceleration. We build on open-source by default — no platform lock-in.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Haal Lab different from a generic AI agency?",
      answer:
        "Haal Lab treats AI as an engineering discipline, not a demo factory. Every system we ship includes evaluation harnesses, observability, and documentation. We build on open-weight models and open-source infrastructure so you own the system, the weights, and the data — no platform lock-in.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I engage Haal Lab?",
      answer:
        "We work in four stages: Discovery (understand the problem), Architecture (design the system end-to-end), Build (engineering in demonstrable increments), and Deploy (ship to your environment with runbooks and observability). Start by contacting us at hello@haal-lab.solutions.",
    },
  ],
  solutions: [
    {
      question: "What is a local AI system?",
      answer:
        "A local AI system runs entirely on your own hardware — workstations, on-prem servers, or air-gapped clusters — without sending data to a cloud API. Haal Lab builds local AI systems using open-weight models in GGUF format, with llama.cpp and vLLM runtimes, and CUDA acceleration where GPUs are available.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a RAG system and does Haal Lab build them?",
      answer:
        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an architecture that grounds language model responses in your own documents. A RAG system retrieves relevant passages from a knowledge base, then feeds them to the LLM as context. Haal Lab builds production RAG systems with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense embeddings), cross-encoder reranking, and source attribution.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is BGE-M3 and why does Haal Lab use it?",
      answer:
        "BGE-M3 is a multilingual embedding model that produces dense, sparse, and ColBERT-style representations in a single pass. Haal Lab uses BGE-M3 for production retrieval because it handles multilingual corpora (such as legal documents across jurisdictions) and supports multi-vector indexing for higher recall.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Haal Lab deploy AI on air-gapped infrastructure?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We build air-gapped deployments for regulated environments — healthcare, finance, government, and legal. The entire stack (models, runtime, retrieval layer, application) runs inside your network with no outbound calls. We use offline model registries and version control to keep the system maintainable.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is AI infrastructure engineering?",
      answer:
        "AI infrastructure engineering is the practice of building the serving, scaling, and observability layer that makes AI systems run reliably in production. Haal Lab builds infrastructure around vLLM, Triton, and Kubernetes — including GPU scheduling, batching, memory tuning, and evaluation-driven CI/CD for prompts and models.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does an AI engagement with Haal Lab take?",
      answer:
        "It depends on scope. A focused prototype can ship in 4–6 weeks. A production system with infrastructure, evaluation, and observability typically takes 3–6 months. Discovery (1–2 weeks) gives us enough context to give you a concrete timeline before any commitment.",
    },
  ],
  about: [
    {
      question: "Is Haal Lab a startup or an agency?",
      answer:
        "Neither, exactly. Haal Lab is an AI engineering company — closer to a specialized engineering consultancy than a software agency. We take on a small number of engagements at a time and ship production AI systems, not demos. Our work is research-driven and engineering-led.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Haal Lab's mission?",
      answer:
        "Haal Lab's mission is to make advanced AI systems private, reliable, and useful in production. We exist to close the gap between AI research and AI in production — particularly for organizations that cannot deploy cloud-hosted models due to privacy, latency, cost, or compliance constraints.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Haal Lab's AI open source?",
      answer:
        "Haal Lab builds on open-weight models (LLMs you can download and run yourself) and open-source infrastructure (llama.cpp, vLLM, Qdrant, Kubernetes). The systems we build for clients are owned by the client — weights, code, and data. We do not lock you into a proprietary platform.",

      question: "How quickly does Haal Lab respond to inquiries?",
      answer:
        "We typically respond within two business days. If your inquiry is time-sensitive, mention it in your message and we will prioritize it. Every serious inquiry gets a concrete technical perspective in the first reply — not a sales script.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I include in my inquiry to Haal Lab?",
      answer:
        "The more context, the better. Tell us: the problem you are solving, what success looks like, what data you have, what constraints (privacy, latency, budget, hardware) we should know about, and your timeline. We will reply with a technical perspective on whether and how we can help.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Haal Lab sign NDAs?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We routinely sign mutual NDAs before detailed technical discussions. We treat your data and your problem description as confidential by default — and because we build private AI systems, data sovereignty is part of our engineering practice, not just a policy.",

    {
      question: "What is the Legal Intelligence System?",

      question: "What does Haal Lab's advisory board do?",
      answer:
        "Our advisory board includes experts in AI research, infrastructure engineering, EU privacy law (GDPR and AI Act), security and threat modeling, and product strategy. They review our architecture, pressure-test our decisions, and ensure our work holds up in production — not just in demos.",

It is designed to validate whether AI can solve your specific problem before committing further budget.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between Professional and Enterprise?",
      answer:
        "Professional (€14,900) delivers one production AI system with integration, evaluation, and 30-day support. Enterprise (€39,900+) adds on-prem/air-gapped deployment, up to 3 interconnected systems, GDPR & EU AI Act compliance, GPU optimization, full observability, team training, and 90-day support with SLA.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Haal Lab offer academic or research pricing?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Our Research & Academic tier offers 30–40% below commercial rates, with engagements scoped to research budgets and grant cycles. We support RAG systems for research corpora, reproducible experiment infrastructure, open-weight models for publishable results, and optional co-authorship on system design.",
