    overview:
      "We build AI systems that operate entirely inside your environment — on workstations, on-prem servers, or air-gapped clusters. Local execution removes the trust, latency, and compliance constraints of cloud-hosted models, while preserving the full capabilities of modern open-weight LLMs. Our deployments are designed around quantized inference runtimes, GPU/CPU co-scheduling, and hardware-aware model selection so that the system remains responsive on whatever hardware you already own.",

      "We design and ship LLM applications that go beyond chat — assistants that take action, agents that orchestrate tools, and automation systems that integrate cleanly with your existing software. Every application is built with evaluation harnesses, guardrails, and observability from day one, so behaviour stays predictable as you scale from prototype to production traffic.",

Our RAG pipelines combine dense and sparse retrieval, cross-encoder reranking, query rewriting, and source attribution into a single, observable system. For document-heavy domains we add OCR, layout-aware chunking, and table understanding — so the system works on contracts, research papers, and scanned archives, not just clean text.",

That means model serving tuned for your hardware, autoscaling that respects GPU memory, observability that surfaces latency and quality drift, and CI/CD pipelines that evaluate models — not just unit tests. The result is an AI platform your team can iterate on without firefighting.",
